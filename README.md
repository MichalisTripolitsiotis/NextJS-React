My first NextJS project. It is the code from the following [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

I have some really basic knowledge with NodeJS and Express that helped. I decided to complete also this section from the course because I think is really great learning to incorporate Laravel, Next and React in the future.

As a Database you will see that the MongoDB has been used. You will need to create also the database yourself if you want to use the application. I used Atlas.
